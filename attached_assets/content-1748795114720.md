# Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create,  maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the  Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.

Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings,
including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover
entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can
easily be extended through a well-documented extension model.
As of 2024, over 45 million web domains markup their web pages with
over 450 billion Schema.org objects.
Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others
already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences.


Founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex,
Schema.org vocabularies are developed by an open [community](https://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg) process,
using the [public-schemaorg@w3.org](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg)
mailing list and through [GitHub](http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg).


A shared vocabulary makes it easier for webmasters and developers to decide
on a schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts.
It is in this spirit that the founders, together with the
larger community have come together - to provide a shared collection of schemas.
